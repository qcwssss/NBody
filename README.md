# NBody
Animating simulation of celestial movement

## Description
- NBody is an animating simulator of celestial movement which allows users to input multiple planetary parameters via a text file to generate an animation of planetary movements based on Newtonâ€™s law of universal gravitation.
- Implemented with Model-View-Controller designing pattern in *Java*.


### How to run NBody?
To animating the simulation of celestial movement, run NBody class with command line arguments
- eg. `20000000.0 20000.0 data/planets.txt`.
  - the first arguement is the total running time, the second is the time difference will be incremented from 0. The animation will stop when it reach to the total running time.
  - The third arugment is a file stores 
    1. *the number of bodies*
    2. *the radius of the universe*
    3. *the position, velocity, mass and image path*
